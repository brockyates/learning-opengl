# OpenGL Graphics Demo

This project is a collection small OpenGL demos that I've built as a learn OpenGL.

## Credits

This project started out by following along with the development of Yan Chernikov's Hazel Engine: https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel.git. In particular the Shader class responsible for loading shader programs and setting uniforms has not changed significantly from the Hazel implementation.
