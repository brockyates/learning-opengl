# Learning about graphics with OpenGL 

This project is a small OpenGL demo application that I built to learn graphics programming. Rather than a properly designed and abstracted rendering engine, it is a simple learning tool to help me work may way through the basics of rendering and graphics.

This is my first graphics project, so my emphasis is on understanding the rendering pipeline, organizing my classes around the API, and thinking about how the application should handle the management of windows, scenes, events, and other relatively low-level concerns.

Once I have a better handle on these details, I'll be adding more interesting demos and eventually switch my focus to more advanced shader code.

The UI is built with [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git).

## Getting started

For now this demo is only supported on Windows and must be built with Visual Studio 2017 Platform Toolset v141.

### Pre-requisites

- Visual Studio 2017 with Platform Toolset: Visual Studio 2017 v141
- Graphics support for OpenGL 4.6

### Build steps

1. Clone repository with **--recurse-submodules**
1. Run build script from **Developer Command Prompt for VS2017**

Example: clone with SSH and build
```git
git clone git@github.com:brockyates/learning-opengl.git --recurse-submodules
cd graphics
BuildVS2017.bat
```
