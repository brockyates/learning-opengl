# OpenGL Graphics Demo

This project is a collection small OpenGL demos that I am building as I learn graphics programming. Rather than a properly designed and abstracted rendering engine, think of this project as a learning resource to document my progress through examples.

I have left the code deliberately low-level, and have opted to keep interfaces and wrappers around OpenGL API calls to a minimum. This is the recommended approach in a few of the learning materials that I'm working through, with the intent that it facilitates my understanding of the OpenGL pipeline.

Each demo is relatively self-contained so that it can be read and easily understood without much external context. The trade-off is that some level of code duplication exists across demos and the implementation will have obvious opportunities for performance improvement. Again, the intent is to document and demonstrate the learning process. Once I have cleared all of my objectives here I may start another project where I build a more robust and well-designed rendering engine.

The UI is built with [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui.git).
